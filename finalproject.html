You must include a description of your concept, a technical
implementation section that includes a schematic, circuit,
code, and a writeup of how everything works, and include your demo video.
These are due by URL submission on Sunday March 14th.

For your technical documentation you need to include schematics, circuit,
code, and technical write up. You will receive full marks if your schematic,
circuit, and code are correct and well done, and if your technical write up
is good at explaining both your concept and your implementation.

            <h1>Jacob's Final Project</h1>
            
            <h3>Here's the documentation for my final project</h3>
            <br/>
            <br/>
            
            <p3>
                For my final project I decided to make a device that would automatically open or close the blinds in my room. While I was initally <br/>
                considering pulling up my blinds by the string, I decided that would be a lot of weight for any of the components in our toolkits to handle without a strong <br/>
                set of gears, and therefore a big hassle. So, I instead developed a device that would rotate the rod on my blinds that tilts the shades, allowing more or less light into the room. <br/>
                I wanted this device to be controlled by a remote contorl as well as function autonomously each morning.
                <br>
                To create this device, I utilized the stepper motor to rotate the blinds. Once I modeled and 3D printed a coupler that would connect the stepper motor shaft to the blind opening rod,<br/>
                all I had to do was create a housing for the motor, arduino, IR sensor, and stepper controller. Once I modeled 3D printed the chasis, the physical side of the project was done. After I flashed <br/>
                the appropriate code onto the arduino, my project was done. Below are the steps I took to create this device.
            </p3>
            
            <p3>This is the schematic for my circuit. Luckily, all I had to do was plug my IR sensor and stepper motor controller into the PWM ports on the arduino - no breadboard or resistors necessary.</p3>

            <br/>
                    
            <p3>Here is my implemented circuit. It is pretty simple since the only things connected are the joystick and the green LED. The blue lead coming off
            the joystick is not connected to anything, but could allow the button on the joystick to be programmed.</p3>
            <br/>

            <br/>
            <br/>
            <br/>
                
            <p3>This is the code for the circuit, which has two parts. The first part sends the data from the 'Analog In' pins (which are connected to the Joystick) over the
            serial port to be interpreted by the P5 javascript code. The second part recieves the data from the P5 javascript code, which is sending keypresses from my 
            keyboard. Depending on if a keypress is 'w' or 's', the voltage to the LED will increase or decrease.</p3>         
            <br/>
            <br/>

            <br/>
            <br/>

            <p3> This is the P5 javascript code that is run on the 'Web Server for Chrome' program. This code first sets up the conenction to the serial port and creates a canvas
            for the program to draw on. The serialEvent function reads the joystick data over the serial port, and the keyPressed fucntion reads the input from my keyboard. 
            The brightness value can be set between 0 and 9, which corresponds to the increments in the arduino firmware that increment or decrement the LED brightness.
            In the draw function, the character and brightness are being updated every time the function is called. The x and y variables are for the x and y location of the character.
            They are being mapped from 0-1000 (roughly the range of the joystick output) to 30-1000 for the y direction and 30-2000 for the x direction
            (the pixel ranges where the character can be seen on the drawing canvas)</p3>

            <br/>
    
            <p3>Here's the circuit in action! The video is attempting to show a lot of things so it's a bit long, but what's important is:</p3>
            <br/>
            <p3>Whichver key is pressed on the keyboard updates the character on the screen</p3>
            <br/>
            <p3>The joystick input will move the character around on the screen</p3>
            <br/>
            <p3>If 'w' or 's' is pressed, it will either increase or decrease the brightness number in the bottom right corner of the screen and increase
             or decrease the LED brightness on the arduino.</p3>
