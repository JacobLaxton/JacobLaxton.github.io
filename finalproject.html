You must include a description of your concept, a technical
implementation section that includes a schematic, circuit,
code, and a writeup of how everything works, and include your demo video.
These are due by URL submission on Sunday March 14th.

For your technical documentation you need to include schematics, circuit,
code, and technical write up. You will receive full marks if your schematic,
circuit, and code are correct and well done, and if your technical write up
is good at explaining both your concept and your implementation.

            <h3>Here's the documentation for my final project</h3>
            <br/>

            <p3>
                For my final project I decided to make a device that would automatically open or close the blinds in my room. While I was initally <br/>
                considering pulling up my blinds by the string, I decided that would be a lot of weight for any of the components in our toolkits to handle without a strong <br/>
                set of gears, and therefore a big hassle. So, I instead developed a device that would rotate the rod on my blinds that tilts the shades, allowing more or less light into the room. <br/>
                I wanted this device to be controlled by a remote contorl as well as function autonomously each morning.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                To create this device, I utilized the stepper motor to rotate the blinds. Once I modeled and 3D printed a coupler that would connect the stepper motor shaft to the blind opening rod,<br/>
                all I had to do was create a housing for the motor, arduino, IR sensor, and stepper controller. Once I modeled 3D printed the chasis, the physical side of the project was done. After I flashed <br/>
                the appropriate code onto the arduino, my project was done. Below are the steps I took to create this device.

            <p3>
                This is the schematic for my circuit. Luckily, all I had to do was plug my IR sensor and stepper motor controller into the PWM ports on the arduino - no breadboard or resistors necessary.

            <p3>
                Here is the 3d model of the stepper coupler and the device chasis. The chasis conceals all parts of the device, except for the motor, which is exposed to<br/>
                connect to the blind opening rod.

            <p3>This is the code for the circuit, which has two parts. The first part sends the data from the 'Analog In' pins (which are connected to the Joystick) over the
            serial port to be interpreted by the P5 javascript code. The second part recieves the data from the P5 javascript code, which is sending keypresses from my 
            keyboard. Depending on if a keypress is 'w' or 's', the voltage to the LED will increase or decrease.</p3>
