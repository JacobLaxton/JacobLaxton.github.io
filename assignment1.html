        <p1 width="200px">Here's the schematic for the circuit. I utilized 220 ohm resisters for each LED. I was aiming for 160 ohms to provide 20mA of
            current for each LED, but 220 ohms was the next largest resistor we had in the kit. </p1>

        <p1 width="200px">Here's a picture of the implemented circuit. I tried to keep the wiring as simple as possible and correlated
            wire color with LED color</p1>

        <p1 width="200px">And here's a gif of the code in action! I opted for 3 seconds on and 3 seconds off for each LED, with 1 second staggering
            between them</p1>
