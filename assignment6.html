            <p3> This is the schematic for my circuit. I connected our DC wall adapter to our LED
            strips, regulating the voltage with a N-MOSFET Transistor. The transistor is controlled
            by a capactive sensor. I utilized two 1 Megaohm resistors for the capactive sensing ciruit,
            and a metal cup as the capacitor</p3>

            <p3>Here is a picture of my implemented circuit. The red and black leads going off the table are connected to our 12V wall adapter</p3>

            <p3> This is the code for the circuit. I have a 5 second calibration phase, then in the loop I have the sensor input mapped to the LED brightness.</p3> 
            <p3> I added print statements for the min and max sensor inputs to make sure the calibration was done correctly.</p3>
