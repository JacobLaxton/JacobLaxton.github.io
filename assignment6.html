            <br/>
            <br/>
            
            <p3>This is the schematic for my circuit. I connected the provided joystick to the 'Analog In' pins on the Arduino, and connected an LED to pin 5.</p3>

            <p3>Here is my implemented circuit. It is pretty simple since the only things connected are the joystick and the green LED. The blue lead coming off
            the joystick is not connected to anything, but could allow the button on the joystick to be programmed.</p3>
            <br/>

            <p3>This is the code for the circuit, which has two parts. The first part sends the data from the 'Analog In' pins (which are connected to the Joystick) over the
            serial port to be interpreted by the P5 javascript code. The second part recieves the data from the P5 javascript code, which is sending keypresses from my 
            keyboard. Depending on if a keypress is 'w' or 's', the voltage to the LED will increase or decrease.</p3>         
            <br/>

            <br/>

            <p3> This is the P5 javascript code that is run on the 'Web Server for Chrome' program. This code first sets up the conenction to the serial port and creates a canvas
            for the program to draw on. The serialEvent function reads the joystick data over the serial port, and the keyPressed fucntion reads the input from my keyboard.
            In the draw function, the character and brightness are being updated every time the function is called.</p3>

            <br/>
    
            <p3>Here's the circuit in action! The video is attempting to show a lot of things so it's a bit long, but what's important is:</p3>
            <br/>
            <p3>Whichver key is pressed on the keyboard updates the character on the screen</p3>
            <br/>
            <p3>The joystick input will move the character around on the screen</p3>
            <br/>
            <p3>If 'w' or 's' is pressed, it will either increase or decrease the brightness number in the bottom right corner of the screen and increase
             or decrease the LED brightness on the arduino.</p3>
