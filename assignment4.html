            <p3> This is the schematic for my circuit. I utilized two 1 Megaohm resistors for the capactive sensing ciruit, and a metal cup as the capacitor</p3>

            <p3>Here is a picture of my implemented circuit. I matched the colors of the servo wires to help readability.</p3>

            <p3> This is the code for the circuit. I have a 5 second calibration phase, then in the loop I have the sensor input mapped to the servo output.</p3> 
            <p3> I added print statements for the min and max sensor inputs to make sure the calibration was done correctly.</p3>

            <p3>Here's the circuit in action! With more resistance I could have activated the servo from farther away, but I thought this distance was good for now.</p3>
