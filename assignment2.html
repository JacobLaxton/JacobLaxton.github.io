            <p1> This is the schematic for my circuit. I utilized 220 Ohm resistors for the LEDs, and a 1000 Ohm resitor for my switch. Justification for these choices can be seen below</p1>

            <p1>Here is a picture of my implemented circuit. Red is power, black is ground, green is for the green LED, yellow is for the red LED, and blue is for the switch</p1>

            <p1> This is the code for the circuit. I utilized a for loop to fade the green LED when the button is pressed. As explained below, I utllized a squared function to have a more appealing fade.</p1>
